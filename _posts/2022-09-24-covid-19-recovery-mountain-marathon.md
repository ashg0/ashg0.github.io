#### **COVID-19 Infection**
After all, I have been infected with COVID-19. I guess the infection route was an Izakaya restaurant because they started temporarily closed after I visited.
- 8/29(Mon): Sore throat
- 8/30(Tue): Slight fever
- 8/31(Wed): 38.0C at night
- 9/1(Thu): 38.0C in the morning. I used sick leave for work.
- 9/2(Fri): Almost recovered. I ate a pear sent by my parents, but it was not as sweeter as I thought. It might have been a mild taste disorder.
- ~9/8(Thu): Self-quarantine.

I used SEIYU Net Supermarket while self-quarantine. If we live alone, we have to rely on delivery. But this operation also relies on trust that people will behave well.  
My symptom wasn't bad, but I was sad that I had to miss a plan with my friend I hadn't seen in 6 or 7 years. He has gone back overseas, so I don't know when I will see him again.  
For the past 2 and a half years, I haven't experienced severe conditions due to the pandemic. I might be one of the most unaffected people because I'm exactly a healthy 20's guy working in the IT industry from home living alone. Finally, I feel like getting involved in society.

#### **Mountain Marathon(Sep. 10)**
I was thinking about what I wanted to do when I finally could go outside. Then, I decided to go to the mountain to exercise extremely, just to eat delicious foods.
Although I was a little concerned about the affection of COVID-19 on my body and getting out of shape due to 10 days of restraint, I decided to go as far as I could go because there are some escape paths to shorten the route.

I didn't feel any degradation in my cardiopulmonary and endurance at that time. I was relieved on this point because I had heard that not a few people have long-COVID symptoms.
Regarding climbing, I wondered if runners of trail running can run even uphill because I barely did that. On the way downhill, I could go with the tempo to just put my leg on the ground.  
Some people say that we can organize our thinking while walking alone apart from noisy/annoying places both physically and mentally. However, I don't have too many things to think about so far. Of course, we need to train ourselves to state something and not be able to acquire it naturally. So that I have been trying this blog though.
