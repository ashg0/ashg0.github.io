In conclusion, I have improved myself gradually and steadily in this year. Basically, I've been following my principle, do it a lifetime. There was no dramatic change, however, the progress.
- Move to Urawa  
It was a good oppotunity to finish an experimental days in small 4.5-jou room. Eventually, I realized I had stresses from the small room, that affected my performance and mental health. 
- Thailand  
Thaifood version of Sushizanmai was a most memorable. I felt the variety of taste was too simplified if I remember correctly.
- Cooking  
I have completed Doi-Yoshiharu's 100 recipes book in 2 month.
- Gardening  
Same as cooking, I spent much time and enegy on it witout any hesitation.
- Mt. Fuji  
I endangered myself low body temperature since I was wearing too little clothing. In terms of climbing, I think I would start from the sea next time as it was not tough.
- Running  
Finally, I paid for the registration of MDS 2024. I have ran more than 40km/day in every weekend from September. So, most of weekend are spent for just running and recovering, but it was able to avoid feeling bad for not doing anything in a weekend.
- Work  
I have been building my skill for the infrastructure engineer this year. Ansible could be added to my job resume. Now, I feel this position is one of the most suitable(Thanks HR department of my first company)
